"536","47740572291","Phil, I don't know why I got selected (it's my third time in a month), first time it was my first day in Flickr, and I didn't even know what explore was, I had to Google lol.
And Googleing, seems like it's a little bit random, but what the algorithm prefers is a photo that stands out for various reasons (many interactions, many likes or comments) and also because it's different from the others . It's not a coincidence I guess, that two photos that were chosen for explore are m heavily postproduced to look like paintings, while another  was done using the out of focus technique + textures.
Just my two cents, I might be completely wrong..."

"1295","46826805065","It's strange how some things you learn when you're young stay with you for life. Nearly fifty years ago when I was entering camera club competitions I quickly learned that club judges had an irrational hatred of what was called &quot;unsupported foliage&quot;. Much as I like this image, I find myself wanting to crop/clone out the foliage at the top of the image. I'm not saying I'm correct, just that it was drummed into my head at a comparatively young age and there it has stayed.
When I think back to some of the photos that did well for me in competitions I cringe with embarrassment. They might have adhered to the rules and been beautifully printed but they were boring. I'm still producing boring images most of the time but at least nowadays I recognise the fact!"

"1690","32797972267","Hey Mark
I have admired your website .... a strong portfolio about your beautiful work !
a few minor comments, which in my opinion could be different or perhaps better.

Botanical: too big differences in the photos.
personally I find the last 2 very beautiful and especially special.
does not fit with the rest.
nicer to present in series .... that reinforces the photos.

Urban: perhaps stronger to split into Architecture and Urban life.
the architectural photos together give a strongly balanced whole.
the people in architecture, presented together, also more balanced.

maybe you totally disagree with me .... ;-))
no problem .... just as well a nice presentation of your photography.
Have a nice day Mark !"

"1850","46949381394","This is wonderful Courtney  A striking image it is so unusual and creative"
"1851","46949381394","Fantastic wildscape scene Courtney.  I like how the deer seem to have stopped there and are looking around, perhaps thinking &quot;I don't think we'll find much to eat out there.&quot;  Perfect time of day to get those beautiful shadows and light.  Bravo!"
"1852","46949381394","This would be a top-notch shot without the deer. Adding them to the equation with their alert poses just catapults the image over the top. Way to be ready for the moment and way to nail this awesome scene Courtney! The sun angle creates some fantastic  shadows and highlights the vegetation beautifully! Great photography work!"

E sim, nada aprender
...Com os próprios erros.

Convite à meditação! Fé na vida!

Aproveite bem seu tempo!
Honestamente cumpra sua obrigação!
Dosando prazer, lazer! Em todo momento!
Vida é prece! É devoção!

Coisas banais! Antigos tesouros!
Equívocos fatais! Tons de eternidade!
O sol lento! Farto, duradouro!
Vida! Brilho! Luz! Claridade!

Lenta, cada manhã fluía mansamente!
Tranquila! Eu fã vida afora!
Não como as manhãs, estas de agora!
Que chegam e se vão rapidamente!

Fervorosa...
Lá vou eu!... ... ... Vania Dramis pimenta"
